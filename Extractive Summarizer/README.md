Considering the exponential increase of data being stored worldwide, it is quickly becoming impractical to summarize this data
manually and extract important information in a short time. In an attempt to save time for the developers, we propose a system which
summarizes software engineering bug reports automatically using several text analysis techniques such as keyword extraction using
the Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE) algorithm and semantic similarity using the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE).

1. The implementation of RAKE algorithm is taken from this (https://github.com/zelandiya/RAKE-tutorial) repository. 

2. "annotation.xml" contains the annotated version of the dataset.

3. "bugreports.xml" contains the actual dataset. 

4. Run "Parse1.py" to parse data and make the summary for the first annotation. Similarly do this for 2nd annotation and 3rd annotation .
